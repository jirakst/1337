1) A detailed description of the multi-agent system, including the agents' architecture, abilities, and behaviors:

There are currently two agents operating in a grid environment called 'TheWorld.' Each agent has a shared policy network, a communication module, and a set of collected resources. The shared policy network is a simple neural network with two hidden layers, taking in the agent's state as input and producing action probabilities as output. The communication module is another neural network that processes the communication state, which includes the agent's position, resource positions, and information about collected resources, to generate messages for other agents.

Agents can perform 5 actions - move in four directions (up, down, left, right) and collect resources by selecting the 'collect resource' action. They also communicate with each other by exchanging messages, which can inform them of the resources collected by other agents. This communication allows them to cooperate and share information about the environment.


2) Code implementation of the system, including any machine learning models or algorithms used:

I used the PyTorch library because it's more suitable for rapid prototyping, and the OpenAI Gym library for defining the environment. The main components are as follows:

- TheWorld: A custom Gym environment representing the grid world in which agents operate. It defines the observation space, action space, and the dynamics of the environment.
- Agent: A class representing a shared (individual) agent, which includes a shared policy network, a communication module, and a set of collected resources. The Agent class also provides methods for selecting actions, communicating with other agents, and updating the set of collected resources.
- Communication: A class representing the communication module of each agent, implemented as a neural network that processes the communication state and generates messages for other agents.
- train function: A function for training the agents' shared policy network using policy gradient methods, specifically the REINFORCE algorithm.


3) Documentation of the experiment setup and evaluation metrics used to assess the system's performance:

The experiment setup consists of training the agents in the grid environment for a fixed number of episodes. At each time step, agents select actions based on their current state and perform these actions in the environment. They also communicate with each other, exchanging messages containing information about collected resources. The agents' shared policy network is then updated using the reinforce algorithm to maximize the total rewards collected across all agents.

The primary evaluation metric for the system's performance is the total rewards collected by the agents, which represents the number of resources collected by all agents throughout an episode. Other metrics of interest may include the average number of steps taken to collect resources and the number of episodes until convergence.


4) Analysis of the results and any recommendations for improving the system:

The analysis of the results would require evaluating the total rewards collected by the agents over time, their ability to cooperate, and the efficiency with which they collect resources. If the agents' performance is suboptimal, several recommendations for improving the system can be taken:

- Improving the policy network architecture: The current policy network is relatively simple, and a more complex architecture with additional layers, different activation functions, or more neurons could potentially learn more effective policies.
- Enhancing the communication module: The current communication module is relatively simple and may not convey enough information for effective cooperation. Experimenting with different message representations or encoding additional information, such as the agent's intentions or past experiences, could improve cooperation.
- Introducing a centralized critic or value function: Incorporating a centralized critic or value function could help agents learn more effectively by reducing the variance in the policy gradient estimates and providing a better understanding of the state values.
- Employing advanced training techniques: Implementing advanced algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), or multi-agent extensions like MADDPG
- Exploration strategies: Experiment with different exploration strategies, such as epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann exploration, or curiosity-driven exploration, to encourage agents to explore the environment more effectively and discover better policies.
